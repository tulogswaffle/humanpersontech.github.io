<h2>
    it all started when i was with an argument with someone
    <br>
and i started replying and reacting to all of his messages with the disguised face emoji
<br>
disguised face was then born
<br>
disguised face later became a criminal, commiting murder and kidnapping 
<br>
months later i was in a minecraft server with a friend
<br>
i started using command blocks to display the message "BUILD A SHRINE TO THE MOON MEN" while building more moon men
<br>
later in the same server i started building the yellow sun men and the orange morning men
<br>
now we go into the moon men's universe
<br>
they were in a war with the sun men
<br>
after it ended they discovered disguised face who later became the other enemy of the moon men
<br>
later in another minecraft server there was a bug causing another version of disguised face to appear next to the sun
<br>
this disguised face was later named "teams disguised face" and was part of it's own alternate universe
<br>
and then after another battle disguised face and the sun men teamed up to defeat the moon men
