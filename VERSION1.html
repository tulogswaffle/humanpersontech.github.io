  <h3>
    BEGINNINGS
<Br>
A shout comes through a newly made thing, made from the nothing of nothingness.
“I thou created 2 others, Karl and Carol. Thou name Dylan!” Dylan being the 1st god, Carol being the 2nd, and Carol being the 3rd. They shout in symphony, “We create a world of good, and evil.” Thus creating a team of good and evil who fight together who decides what team shall win in this world. Karl lived forever, still living in the skies roaming. Dylan died during the apocalypse with carol but revived him and carol in the Mass Revival by Karl in 2009.

From the works of hell created by Dylan and Karl, is someone named Monochrome Disguised Face. (MDF) And from the works of heaven created by the 3 Gods (Dylan, Karl, Carol) are three representing the Three Gods but human named “Normal Disguised Face (NDF), Microsoft Teams Disguised Face (TDF), And 3D Disguised Face (3DF).

MDF Looked to the sky and saw a red spot on the moon. These are called the Moon Men. He looked down and noticed he had a caveman next to him with a moon man on him but not red.
“Interesting,” he said. He wiggled it and thought of the concept of “Wiggle The Willy” where you wiggle something called a human’s willy. This spawned the confirmed theory of the Moon Men and the game of Wiggle The Willy. He kept wiggling it till something weird and white came out.
This was called “Kum” by MDF Aka Cum in Modern English. The first person to cum lost. (This was changed to last in the Future by Dylan And Karl + Carol.)

MDF had no one to spread it to until an event in 2 universes made by someone else with disguised faces collided creating the FMDF. (Fool Disguised Face Monochrome)

FMDF Had a plan that was shared with MDF. In 25 years Dylan would release electronics to the world with something called screens and games. If they could hack into the devices they can display Messages to come somewhere displayed on their screens and trap victims. Most people would think that maybe the game is asking them to do something so they could fix something or so. All they had to do is just wait for Dylan to release it not knowing what dangers he would also unleash to the public universe, and the world just in general, ya know.
<br>
ENSLAVED 3
<br>
1 year before the apocalypse, MDF has captured 3 people to be enslaved, Pyro, a crazed mercenary with no idea for what intentions he is doing, Goldie, a dog that can be decoded to speak english, and The Minions, short yellow things that are completely unintelligible. MDF has enslaved the unintelligible 3 (TU3) and make them do his bidding or else they have to face the consequences of torture, or even death. Pyro has tried his best to start a fire, and burn the basement down to the ground, but to his avail, he has been caught and punished as goldie and the minions watch. 1999, January 1st, the day where pyro, goldie, and the minions decide to escape. After MDF leaves the basement to plan with FMDF for the apocalypse, Pyro, goldie, and the minions crawl into the vents, looking for an escape hatch. The vents only lead to a room with a phone, and an upwards vent with a fan atop. TU3 goes to the phone room, and calls Dylan and Honeybee to try to save them soon. 1999, January 14th, the day Honeybee and Dylan save TU3. Dylan throws a lighter and a gas canister for pyro to use and burn the basement when they are out. Dylan and honeybee break into the bunker, killing the guards, and finally saving TU3, and when they finally feel the grass on their feet, Pyro burns the place down to the ground, turning into ashes. Dylan drives TU3 to a local hospital to check on their health after being punished and enslaved so much. 1999 January 23rd, they came out of the hospital fine and glad.
